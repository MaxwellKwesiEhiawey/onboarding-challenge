# onboarding-challenge


The SwiftUI framework has the "Tabview" component that picks a number of views.

Each view can receive a tag.

The "Tabview" accepts "selection" argument which can be updated by a state variable.

Updating the selection with a tag value will present the view with that tag value only.

This can be used to switch views without navigation/routing.

This is the idea used for the onboarding challenge for iPadOS/MacOS.
